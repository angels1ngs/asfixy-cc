# ℹ️ Asfixy V7.3
Its a project based 100% on javascript to make cheats on cookie clicker or others javascript games with an internal custom ui to execute and create u own auto farms for any game.

# 🌐 Closed Source
Sadly its a close source project because of some past skids from my other projects.

# 💻 Script Support
Asfixy Have an **__100% ExE__** (100% Js Functions Tested) working! This is, u can run any js code direcly from a bypassed internal Ui.

# 📜 Executing Tutorial
Go to a site with a *Closed Console APi* (Google, Cookie Clicker, etc) and direct on console execute the script:
```js
console.clear();

fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jota-js/Asfixy/main/Internal-Ui")
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(script => {
    eval(script);
  })
```

and now u will have a 100% ExE power at u hands.
